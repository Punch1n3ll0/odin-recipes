    <ul> 
        <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li> 
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons ground paprika</li> 
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li> 
        <li>2 eggs</li> <li>½ cup milk</li> 
        <li>½ (16 ounce) package saltine crackers, crushed</li> 
        <li>½ cup dry potato flakes</li> 
        <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li> 
        <li>4 (3/4 inch) thick pork chops</li> 
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li> 
        <li>1 ½ cups vegetable oil for frying</li> 
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2> 
    
    <ol> 
        <li>In a shallow bowl, mix 1 1/2 cup of flour, paprika, and garlic powder. In a second shallow bowl, whisk together the eggs and milk until thoroughly blended. In a third bowl, combine the crushed cracker crumbs, potato flakes, and 1/2 cup of flour.</li> 
        <li>With a fork, prick the pork chops thoroughly to tenderize the meat. Season the chops with salt and pepper.</li> 
        <li>Gently press the pork chops into the flour to coat, and shake off the excess flour. Dip into the beaten egg mixture, then press each chop into the cracker crumb mixture. Gently toss between your hands so any crumbs that haven't stuck can fall away</li> 
        <li>Heat the oil in a large, deep skillet over medium heat, and gently place the pork chops into the hot oil. Fry the chops until the meat is no longer pink in the center and the crust is crisp and golden brown, about 5 minutes per side. Remove the chops from the pan, and drain the excess oil on paper towels.</li> 
    </ol>
