            <li>salt to taste</li> 
            <li>2 tablespoons hot pepper sauce (such as Tabasco®), or to taste</li> 
            <li>½ teaspoon Cajun seasoning blend (such as Tony Chachere's®), or to taste</li> 
            <li>4 bay leaves</li> 
            <li>½ teaspoon dried thyme leaves</li> 
            <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can stewed tomatoes</li>

            <li>2 (10 ounce) packages frozen cut okra, thawed</li>

            <li>1 pound lump crabmeat</li> 
            <li>3 pounds uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined</li> 
            <li>2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li> 
        </ul>
    
    <h2>Directions</h2> 
        <ol> 
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li> 
            <li>Make the roux: Whisk together flour and 3/4 cup bacon drippings in a large, heavy saucepan over medium-low heat until smooth. Cook roux, whisking constantly, until it turns a rich mahogany brown color. This can take 20 to 30 minutes; watch heat carefully and whisk constantly or roux will burn. Remove from heat; continue whisking until mixture stops cooking.</li> 
            <li>Make the gumbo: Place celery, onion, green bell pepper, and garlic into the work bowl of a food processor, and pulse until all vegetables are very finely chopped.</li> 
            <li>Stir vegetables into the roux, and mix in sausage. Bring mixture to a simmer over medium-low heat, and cook until vegetables are tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.</li> 
            <li>Combine water and beef bouillon cubes in a large Dutch oven or soup pot and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Stir until bouillon cubes dissolve, then whisk roux mixture into the boiling water.</li> 
            <li>Reduce heat to a simmer and mix in sugar, salt, hot pepper sauce, Cajun seasoning, bay leaves, thyme, stewed tomatoes, and tomato sauce. Simmer soup over low heat for 1 hour; mix in 2 teaspoons of file gumbo powder at the 45-minute mark.</li> 
            <li>Meanwhile, melt 2 tablespoons bacon drippings in a skillet over medium heat. Add okra and vinegar and cook for 15 minutes; remove okra with a slotted spoon, and stir into the simmering gumbo.</li> 
            <li>Mix in crabmeat, shrimp, and Worcestershire sauce, and simmer until flavors have blended, 45 more minutes. Stir in 2 more teaspoons of file gumbo powder just before serving.</li> 
            <li>Serve hot and enjoy.</li> 
        </ol>
