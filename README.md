# odin-recipes

The first project assignment in the Odin Project.

I will be demonstrating what I've learned using CLI Chromium, VS Code, Git, and HTML.

Note: By using `git add .` I've unintentionally applied idenitical commit messages to multiple files/directories which is not best practice. I will be commiting more frequently and working on only one file at a time in the future.
